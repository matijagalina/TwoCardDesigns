# TwoCardDesigns

Two website cards designed entirely using CSS Grid.

Project was inspired by Tania Rascia's article "Design for Developers: Specific Steps to Improve Your Website Design" (https://www.taniarascia.com/design-for-developers/).
There she has designed two sets of cards as a base on which she explained design basics for developers.
Tania's final result:

My motivation for this project was to show how easier is to develop those elements using CSS Grid and to
declutter html file of unneccesary div's.

My final result had 20 lines fewer in html and the structure was more cleaner.
BONUS : I had changed the design and layouts of the cards but the html code of each card was the same - just to show
the possibilities and power which comes with CSS Grid.
